# Reproducing indirect bugs

We prepare the steps to reproduce the 8 indirect bugs in `reproduce_bugs.py`.
As claimed in the paper, Sieve does not guarantee to consistently reproduce the 8 indirect bugs as these bugs are not directly triggered by the test plans generated by our Sieve.
To reproduce all of them together, please run
```
python3 reproduce_bugs.py -p all -b indirect
```
After it finishes, you will find a `bug_reproduction_stats.tsv`:
